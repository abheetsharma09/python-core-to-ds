# DSA Mastery: Engineering from the Ground Up 🚀

This repository is a deep dive into Data Structures and Algorithms, implemented in Python. Rather than using built-in abstractions, the goal of this project is to implement core structures from scratch to understand memory management, pointer logic, and algorithmic efficiency.

## 🧠 Why Build from Scratch?
While Python provides highly optimized built-in structures like `list`, they act as "black boxes." By implementing a **Dynamic Array** using the `ctypes` module, I have explored:
- **Low-Level Memory Allocation:** How Python interacts with C-style referential arrays.
- **Amortized Time Complexity:** Why doubling the array size (`__resize`) is mathematically more efficient than incremental growth.
- **Manual Pointer Manipulation:** Handling indices without the safety net of high-level methods.
- **Some Basic Principals:** If you do `+ 100` , your `append` becomes $O(n)$ because you'll have to resize too often. If you do `* 2`, you waste more RAM but save time. This is the Time-Space Trade-off.

## 🛠️ Current Implementations

### Custom Dynamic Array (`MyList`)
A complete recreation of the Python List object.
- **Operator Overloading:** Implemented `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `_delitem__` ,`__add__` and `__str__` for a native Python feel.
- **Dynamic Resizing:** Uses a geometric progression (2n) growth strategy to ensure $O(1)$ amortized append time.
- **Key Methods:** `append()`, `pop()`, `find()`, `clear()` , `remove()` ,` insert()`, `reverse()`.
